     NOTICE
     I ended up not solving this pussle!
     There's some raceissue in the way the crane is popping and pushing elements.
     The final outcome is not deterministic.
     If I had more time, I would have re-write it into not using a `var stacks`, but instead
     reduce into an immutable stacks object. Also, not use an Dictionary, but two-dimentional array instead.
     I also tried with a dispatch quere instead of BlockOperation.
     
     Edit: I forgot to sorte the final dictionary before printing it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
